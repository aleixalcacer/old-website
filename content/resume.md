## Professional experience


### Jaume I University

Predoctoral researcher *oct 2021 - present*
: I'm working on my PhD thanks to a FPU contract that I recieved from the Spanish Ministry of Universities.

External lecturer *feb 2021 - mar 2021*
: I taught the second module of the SIQ025 and SIQ525 subjects included in the master's degree in Computational Mathematics.
The topics covered in the module were git and R packages.

Research technician *oct 2018 - aug 2021*
: I was part of the DPI2017-87333-R project of the Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities of Spain.
I was in charge of conducting tests and experiments and analyzing the results.
I also started researching in the field of archetypal analysis, publishing several articles and posters.


### Francesc Alted

Software analyst and designer *oct 2018 - sep 2021*
: I was part of the [ironArray](https://ironarray.io) project.
We developed a new computational engine optimized for big-data applications.


## Open Source Projects


[blosc](https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2) *maintainer <br> 2018 - present*
: Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data.

[caterva](https://github.com/Blosc/Caterva) *lead maintainer <br> 2018 - present*
: Caterva is a multidimensional data container on top of Blosc2.

[memprofiler](https://github.com/aleixalcacer/memprofiler) *creator <br> 2020 - present*
: Memprofiler is a IPython extension for monitoring memory usage of Jupyter notebook cells.

[archetypes](https://github.com/aleixalcacer/archetypes) *creator <br> 2021 - present*
