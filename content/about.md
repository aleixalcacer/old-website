Hi folks!

I am Aleix Alcacer, a software analyst that loves the open-source world. I like to develop new algorithms to improve both the performance and efficiency of projects.

Currently, I am doing a PhD in mathematics at UJI. Also, I am being part of the Blosc Development Team.

In my spare time, I love trail running, traveling, and learning about new cultures. Furthermore, I am an enthusiast of landscape photography.
